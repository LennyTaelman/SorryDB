# Sorry Samples

This directory contains sample JSON files representing individual "sorry" instances for testing purposes. Each JSON file contains exactly one sorry with all the information needed to locally reproduce it.

## Purpose

These samples define the precise interface between:

- The **server** (leaderboard) that provides sorry challenges
- The **client** (theorem proving model) that attempts to solve them. The output of the client should be a single string, replacing the original "sorry".
